# Hello-World
A re-creation of my first Hello World on my Vic-20 in December 1982

My first computer was a Vic-20 - in 1982 at Palo Alto, CA
My first browser was Lynx... it was text only and it was so cool.
My first languages were Micro-Basic and 6502 Assembler
I was once President of the First Amiga User's Group 
In 1984  co-wrote a Pascal compiler for the Tandem Nonstop II
That same year I coded a ray-traced scene with rotating objects, an orbiting camera etc. on the Nonstop
It displayed on *the* color monitor. There was only one for the several thousand student body at Foothill College
My fist games were Pong and Adventure
